# binary-search-tree

Binary trees were invented to make searching faster. Instead of traversing an entire array, or singly-linked-list, one could traverse a doubly-linked-list, or binary tree, in a much faster manner. 
The binary tree is created from a sorted array. Once the tree is created, it can be searched in O(log n), rather than O(n).

# node.rb

The node file contains the Node class, which creates the nodes in the binary tree

# binary-tree.rb

The binary-tree file contains the Tree class, which builds the binary tree, and contains all the methods to work with the tree.
